# Learning Markdown

Headings are made by preceding a word or phrase with  the /#/ symbol. The more symbols, the smaller the heading.  

Add a line break between each line of a paragraph as well as each heading to make things look neater-er.  

bold text by adding /**/ or two underscores before and after whatever you're trying to emphasize  

italicize text by adding just one /*/ before and after whatever it is you're trying to emphasize  

add three /***/ to before and after whatever you're trying to emphasize to bold and italicize!  

preceed whatever you want to be an under quote with />/ and include one in the line breaks between paragraphs to underquote multiple paragraphs  

add an additional />>/ to nest an underquote  

underquotes can contain other formats  

preceed each item with a number /1./ to create an ordered list

for unordered list, preceed items with dashes /-/, asterisks /*/, or plus signs /+/, and indent items to create a nested list  

enclose URLs and emails in angle brackets /<>/ to turn them into links
