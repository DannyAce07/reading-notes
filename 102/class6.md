# Dynamic web pages with Javascript

**Javascript (JS)** is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first class functions.Known as the scripting language for web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

Javascripts dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation, object introspection, and source-code recovery.

**JS Standards are:**
- [ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)
- [ECMAScript International API Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma402/)
> As soon as one browser implements a change it is documented, meaning where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examplesin MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between stages 3 and 4 and usually before a spec is officially published.
