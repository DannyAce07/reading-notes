## Growth Mindset
>A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

To me, a growth mindset is less about focusing on growth and more about rejecting complacency and answering the question on who we want to be. For example, in this bootcamp we students will learn a lot of the skills necessary to get a job and be "good enough" but do we want to be the kind of developers who are *good enough* or do we want to be **too good to get rid of** ?

Keeping myself in a growth mindset:
1. Google isn't your only friend, don't be afraid to ask for help
2. Don't be the smartest person in the room
3. Be better than you were last year, last month, last week
